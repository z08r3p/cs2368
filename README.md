Report Question: 
The “World Tea Organization (WTeaO.org) is a world-wide platform. that unites and serves world tea associations, experts, producers, merchandisers  tea lovers, and promotes the Tea Science, Tea Health, Tea Art, Tea Business and Tea Culture of “Healthy, Harmony, Pure, Nature” all over the world.” .
Having heard of the success of the Mombasa/Nairobi Tea Auctions in Kenya, the World Tea Organization is interested to know more about the auctions. As a specialist in the area of Quan代 写Quantitative Skills for Postgraduate StudiesPython

Using the Excel document, ‘Tea Prices Working Document_Your name’ and the information that you have prepared for the ‘End of Topic Tasks’ from Week 7 to Week 12, prepare a report that includes the following:
ÿ   A description of the data and its source.
ÿ   A description of the sampling method used to draw any random samples and reasoning as to why this method was used.
ÿ   A visual representation of any random sample and the population data.
o   Include a description of the visual representation for both the population data and random sample.
o   Include a comparison of the visual representation of the population data and random sample.
ÿ   A comparison of the key measures of central tendency and dispersion of both the population data and random sample.
o   Include key summary outputs / tables.
o   Include diagrams where appropriate.
ÿ   The probability that the tea prices at the auctions will increase based on previous months’ prices.
o   Include any calculations, data or diagrams that are relevant.
ÿ   The proportion of months where the price of tea at the auctions is lower than $3.80   but above $2.00, expressing this as a percentage.
o   Include an explanation as to what this implies for the price of tea at the auctions in future months.

o   Include your definitions for the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis, and your reasons for their definition.
o   Include information on the test statistics used.
o   Include a description of the critical values and the rules for rejection.
o   Include a conclusion of the test and explain your conclusion.
ÿ   The influence of the demand for tea on the tea prices at the auctions.
o   Include relevant diagrams describing the relationship and a description of the diagram.
o   Include trend(s) identified (if any) of the population data, using appropriate techniques (Least-squares regression or moving averages), and provide reasons for the choice of technique included.
